# Topics
ROS 2 breaks complex systems down into many modular nodes. Topics are a vital element of the ROS graph that act as a bus for nodes to exchange messages.

A node may publish data to any number of topics and simultaneously have subscriptions to any number of topics.

Topics are one of the main ways in which data is moved between nodes and therefore between different parts of the system.

Nous pouvons voir les *Topics* existants dans un terminal :
`ros2 topic list`

Nous pouvons Ã©couter un *Topic* :
`ros2 topic echo <topic>`
